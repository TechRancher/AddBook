Fun JS ES5 and ES6 project.

The app is set up to add a Book with its Title, Author, and ISBN.
The information entered will be saved into local storage. 
The ES5 side in the JS folder in the app.js file does not have the local storage method added.
At the time of the push. appES6.js is the script that index is looking at. This file has the local storage method in it.

Have fun looking around at it and see if you can add the local storage method to the ES5 the app.js file.
